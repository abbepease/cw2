    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>We at The Wildlfe Adoption Agency have been running since 1993 by our founder Abbe Pease. In April of 1992 Abbe went on a trip to Seven Wonders Zoo in Tanzania. After initially being excited for the trip to see all the different types of animals she had researched and loved from a safe distnace she soon realised this was not what she had hoped. The animals looked unhealthy and underweight, but she was even more shocked at the tiny cages that the animals were kept in. The animals did'nt seem to move all day apart from when customers would throw food such as chips and ice cream into the cages. Animals that came close enough for her to touch had serious signs of abuse such as limping and cowering when touched. As she thought it couldn't get any worse it did other visiters were dumping their rubbish in the water for the animals polliting it and could endanger the animals and whennshe brought this up to staff they didnt seem to Care. From this visit she felt compelled to do something to help. She wrote to the world animal protection agency who replied back with a letter saying there was nothing they could do unless there was proof. Abbe was determind to save these animals and find proof therefore she went back and took photos of the animals in their tiny cages accentuating how hollow-cheeked they looked and sent them off to the world animal protection agency who then took their own action to save the animals. Abbe realised how rewarding it felt to be the reason the animals were happier and safer therefore she set up what is known today as the wildlife adoption agency which helps to stop any wonderful spieces of animal go extinct but she cant do this alone. She needs your help</p>
