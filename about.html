<h4>2020 was a year of unusually intense bush fires in many parts of Australia which burt through 46,050,750 acres of land destroying miles upon homes of wildlife habitat and 3500 homes. The fires went on for 11 months  and continually blazed through the night as fire fighters worked 24 hours a day to try and control the blaze. The wildlife adoption agency took note of the fires in june 2019 but when they still hadnt died down several months later we knew we had to do something. Animals that couldn't move fast enough were being burnt alive therefore we teamed up with the australian fire department to go ahead of the blaze and saved 482 Koala bears who reached there arms out to us when we got there. We bought 300 fire resistant blankets to wrap the koalas in when they were being rescused but whne we got there, there was so many more koalas in need than presviously thought. The koalas were put in the back of our truck with food and water to keep them hydrated on their way back to our sanctuary. Each animal was given a medical check before being relased back to the wild (in a safe location away from the bush fires) and if it did have an injuried we made sure they had healed before letting them go. Rescue missions like this cost us thousnads of pounds to treat every animal that is given to us so we put out a go fund me in desperation to fund this mission, the aim was to raise 20 thousand pounds for this mission but you rasied 30 thousand punds for us which meant we could rescuse more animals than we intended to thanks to you. We will be sending everyone who donated a thankyou pack to show what their donations helped.</h4>

<h4>Sea levels are rising over 3.6mm a year meaning animals are slowy loosing habitat every year but none as fast as arctic animals who live on top of the ice like polar bears. Not only is their habitat disappearing into the water but is also melting due to global warming, which will lead to polar bears having no habitat left. Its happening already scientists are already finding extrememly underweight polar bears desperately trying to find somehwere to rest umong ive bergs. We could not watch these magnificant animals suffer any longer and so we promoted the adoption of polar bears above other animals and recieved record breaking adoptions on our website. Your donations have helped us work with local communitues to reduce human-bear conflict but has also helped us track 25 polar bears to see the struggles of their daily lives which will help us determind the perfect way to stop these creatres from going extinct in 2021. Your donations mean more to us than you will evrr know as a non profit organisation we rely on the people beliveing in us and trusting what we do. Thankyou all for anothetr amazing year at the Wildlife Adoption Agency (WAA). </h4>
