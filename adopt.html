<h4>Mountian gorillas are considered endangered by ICUN's red list. Not only are mountain gorillas threatened by loss of habitat due to human encroachment, they have also become victims of human violence. As Civil war rages in Africa, efforts to conserve mountain gorilla popultions have been set of. Here we have Steven the mountain gorilla who was taken into our care 5 years ago as just an infant he has a few words to say about why you should adopt him. "Steven here ive just had my tea if i could describe myself in 3 words I would say whitty, funny and charasmatic. Because I have been here since am infant i am the most friendly with the humans out of all of the gorillas here. I love playing with my brother kevin although we get a bit crazy sometimes and throw our food at each other. I cant be let out in the wild you see because I have been here almost all my life I was never taught and skils but if you could donate anything at all to help feed me evem if its as little as a bamboo shoot for me to eat, every little helps. Thankyou all</h4>

  <h4>Giraffe numbers have plummited by 40% in the last three decades and less than 100,000 remain today due to habitat loss and being poached. Cheryl the giraffe who is at the grand olf age of 20 was brought into our care 5 years ago when she was taken by poachers to be sold to the highest bidder however our team intercepted this auction and bought all the animals with your donations so that they can be safe. Cheryl has a few words to say about why you should adopt her "hey there guys my names cheryl the giraffe im getting quite old now and the team here are just making life as comfortable as they can for me in my last few years your donations have helped so much while i've been here. I contracted GSD which is a skin disease  which affected my limbs and I couldnt walk for a while. By using a very expensive cream the team managed to ease the pain for me and I now walk with confidence. Please donate anything you can to help other animals like me. with love from Cheryl."  </h4>
